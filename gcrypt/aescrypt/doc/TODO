cryptoinit.c:
    1. when the keyfile is in an inconsistent state (fail opening / closing),
    there needs to be a consistent way to deal with shutting down system.
        - if used, secure memory needs to be cleared
        - all key storage needs to be reclaimed
        - solution: 
            * cryptographic initialisation should only allow one process one keyring
            * best way to accomplish - mutex?
