ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
=====================

The crypto libraries use the concept of a global keystore and metakeys.

A metakey is a struct containing the key and additional information. It is 
defined in crypto.h.

The keystore is an array of metakeys, and is kept globally to prevent memory
leakage from not freeing all the memory allocated to keys. This is particularly
relevant when dealing with secure memory, in particular the crypto_shutdown
function. The keystore is defined in crypto.h and initialised in cryptoinit.h
in the crypto_init() function.

A program creates a pointer to a keystore_t and initialises that with 
crypto_init().
