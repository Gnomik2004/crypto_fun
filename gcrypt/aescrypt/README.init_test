To generate the initial test code, run

make init_test

The init_test binary has three use cases:
    1. run without arguments - this will
        1. generate a key
        2. write the key to the file aes.key
        3. wipe the aes.key file securely
    2. run with a filename - this will attempt to load the key in argv[1]
    as a 128-bit key (aka 16 bytes long). If the file is not 16 bytes 
    long, it will fail to load.
    3. run with a filename a keysize - this will attempt to load the key
    in the file specified by argv[1] with the number of bytes specified
    in argv[2].

Playing around:
    Various configuration options are found in config.h. Particularly,
    secure memory usage and key generation.
